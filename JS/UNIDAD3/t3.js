The gods of the sky met to create something that would illuminate it, so they decided to create the Sun. The city in which they met, and which was in the sky, was called Teotihuac√°n. It is said that in that city they lit a huge bonfire and the powerful one who wanted to become the Sun had to throw himself into the bonfire and then reemerge as the Sun. There were two candidates for such an act. The first was big, strong, beautiful and rich, because he wore luxurious clothes with precious stones. This candidate offered gold and jewels as a sign of his pride. The second candidate was small, weak, 'ugly' and penniless. His skin was battered and he wore humble clothing. He could only offer his heart and his feelings and so it was. When the time came to throw himself into the huge bonfire, the great and rich man did not dare, he was afraid and ran away, however, the 'poor man' was very brave and threw himself into the bonfire and came out of it converted into the great Sol. The first candidate felt sorry and then threw himself into the fire. It was then that a second Sun appeared in the sky. The other gods debated and decided that there could not be two suns in the sky, so they decided to turn it off and that was when they transformed it into the Moon. Since then, the Sun and the Moon exist, one gives light and brightness during the day and the other offers the same light, but at night.");
