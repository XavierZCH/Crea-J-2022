I have heard that the people who live on that planet do not take good care of it said the stars. We think she's sick! - exclaimed the bears. And everyone approached the planet to ask what was wrong.Hello Earth! Are you okay? - The moon spoke first. The Earth looked at her with eyes full of tears and could not answer. You're scaring us, Earth! What happens? - the stars asked again very worried. Tell us! they all insisted. I think that people are not aware of the damage they are doing - replied the Earth, very distressed. The moon, the sun, the stars and the two bears looked at her silently waiting for her to continue speaking. Men are burning forests, cutting down trees, filling the sea with garbage, exterminating animals, she said, sobbing the Earth again.Global warming is melting my poles. How do they not notice!? They are destroying nature! -she said covering her face that now looked red and feverish. Some children who were playing in the street heard the conversation. Earth Earth! Do not Cry anymore! - They shouted with all their might so that he could hear them. Tell me little ones! She told them, swallowing back her tears. We will take care of you! We will not allow you to die! - they promised with trembling voice. Earth then felt enormous relief when she saw the transparency of her eyes; she just hoped that as adults they wouldn't forget her promise.");
